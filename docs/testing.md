# Testing

Two players plus **Ability 4** (with `test_keys` = 1) to skip timers is the quickest way. Everything unlocks by wave, so 1v1 works: press Ability 4 at each wave to reach wave 5. If the HUD freezes, the script stopped: the reason is in `Documents\My Games\Project Reclaimer\Logs\client.log` (search for 'Custom game mode stopped').

## Still to test (v0.26)

ZS v0.26 RESULTS
-- Fixed or changed in v0.22-v0.23 --
E1. Bought equipment (cover, radar jammer...) stays in your hands; after using it you can buy another (no softlock)? ->
E2. Equipment and grenades you pick up from the map are no longer deleted? ->
L1. Back to the two-column card layout on all three screens; texts fit? ->
S2. Sword Spartan: 150 percent speed? What armor does it show: yours, or a default Spartan? ->
H1. Health bar: light blue at the bottom centre, the number and bar drop when hit and refill with regen? Hidden while dead? Never stops the HUD (check at 0 health and on body swaps)? ->
-- Not reported yet --
T7. Sword Spartan only on wave 5? First person, sword, green-yellow? ->
B1. No boss in wave 1; at the start of wave 2 an Infected gets the boss message, even with zero kills? ->
B2. Only the boss sees the gold card, as a full-width top row with the other forms one row lower? Everyone else's picker looks normal? After the boss spawns, their picker goes back to normal? ->
B3. After dying as a boss the card is gone; the next wave picks again? ->
B4. Anyone else trying to spawn as a boss can't? ->
B5. Clicking the gold card cycles Juggernaut / Brute Chieftain / Master Chief? ->
B8. Juggernaut clearly tougher than a Flood Tank (about 3x)? ->
B6. Brute Chieftain: giant, very fast, invincibility works? Fits through doorways? Takes a lot more than a few Magnum shots now? ->
B7. Master Chief boss: first person, sword, invisible, dies to headshots now, shields never come back? ->
G1. Arsenal card prices match what you're charged (free_shop 0)? ->
X. HUD froze or vanished (script stopped)? Paste the "Custom game mode stopped" line ->
```
